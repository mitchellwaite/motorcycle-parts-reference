[JH motor club on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBVSfQiUQyrjkj3iOf6Os0Q) has a 2018 EFI KLX 250, and has done a big bore + lidless airbox. There are a number of videos with useful information.

## 351 Big Bore

Bill Blue offers a customized fuel controller for the 351 kit, which is likely to be used w/ a stock or lightly modified intake and an aftermarket exhaust.

## Lidless 351 w/ KLX 250

While tuning can be done with an EJK, better results have been obtained with a Dynojet PCFC. They aren't sold in North America, but Dynojet does sell them in Europe and eBay sellers will ship them worldwide.

A larger injector may also be necessary.
