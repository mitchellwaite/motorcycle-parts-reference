# EFI tuning

[JH motor club on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBVSfQiUQyrjkj3iOf6Os0Q) has a 2018 EFI KLX 250, and has done a big bore + lidless airbox. There are a number of videos with useful information.

For anything 330cc and up, an upgraded/larger fuel injector may be necessary. Otherwise, the injector duty cycle may end up very close to its limits.

Both BEET and Keng Engine offer upgraded injectors.
