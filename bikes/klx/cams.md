# Cam Upgrades

## Web Cam Racing Cams

Web Cam racing cams makes a few different grinds for the KLX 250 and 300. The best "bang for your buck" seems to be the 101 grind, but a 351cc big bore kit will make more of a difference for the same cost. If cost is not a concern, the 351cc big bore kit would definitely make more power with an upgraded cam.

## 2020 KLX 300R/300SM cams

Another option for 2020 and earlier KLX 250/2007 and earlier KLX 300R may be to use OEM cams from the 2020 KLX300R or 2021 KLX300SM. **NOTE** that I have not been able to confirm compatibility (2020 300s use different valve springs and tappets), or the exact differences in lift and cam timing. Anecdotal evidence seems to indicate a boost in peak power over the stock 250 cams.
