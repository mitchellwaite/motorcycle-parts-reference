### Cylinder Heads

There are two different styles of cylinder head for KLX models, "old" and "new". The "new" style heads are easily distinguished when by the presence of a bolt in the middle of the cylinder head on the clutch side of the motor, and by the presence of a valve cover held on by 4 bolts instead of 3.

The "old" cylinder heads were used from 1994 to 2020 on the KLX 250 models, and from 1997 to 2007 on the 300 models. On-road models have provisions for air injection, and EFI models have a slightly different intake boot and provisions for a coolant temperature sensor. The same intake cam and cam gears have been used from 1994-2020 on the 250 models, and from 1997 to 2007 on the 300s. The exhaust cam has had a few P/N updates due to changes to the automatic compression release, but the cam grind is apparently the same. All bikes sold with the old style head have 11.0:1 compression.

The "new" cylider heads have been in use on the Ninja 250SL and Z250SL models sold in europe and asia that use a KLX based motor, and have been introduced elsewhere with the 2020 KLX 300. The SL models and the 2020/2021 KLX 300R both use the same intake and exhaust cams, cam gears, and *do not have automatic compression release*. KLX 300 models sold with the "new" head have 11.1:1 compression, and the 250SL models have 11.3:1 compression.

As of March 5, 2021 I've only seen one parts diagram for the 2021 on-road version of the KLX 300SM. It appears to use the "new" style head, but the cam and cam gear part numbers are different than the off road version. The cams have automatic compression release, and at least looking at the diagram, the cam gears look identical to the "old" style heads. It is not currently known if these cams/cam gears are at all different than those found in the "old" style heads, and if these new P/N superseed the P/N found in the current on-road KLX 250.

I'm currently unaware of the exact differences in design between the two styles of cylinder heads. All bikes share the same 61.2 mm stroke, only differing in bore, so the new heads may have a different chamber design or the bikes shipping with the "new" head may have a different piston to account for the compression differences. The new style head along with the different cams allow the Ninja 250 SL models to make a claimed 20.6 kW (9000 rpm) and 22.6 Nm (8200 rpm), which is a noticeable improvement but a different power curve compared to the KLX.

All the different versions of the KLX cam use 32 teeth gears and the same cam chain p/n, so even though the cam and gear might be different, the 250SL or 300SM cams may work for older KLX owners looking for an upgrade. A 300cc+ cylinder would be recommended unless the KLX is purely street driven, since there will be less low end torque with the 250SL cams otherwise.

_Compatibility is pure speculation at this point, since I have not had my hands on a Z250SL or 300SM cam._ I've included part numbers for those willing to try, feel free to [open an issue here](https://github.com/mitchellwaite/motorcycle-parts-reference/issues) and let me know the results.

__Caution__: Some shift levers (such as the MSR SF-6413) do not have the pinch bolt in the correct location to interface with the cutout on the shift shaft, and thus do not guard against inadvertent removal of the shift lever. This is especially a problem with aluminum shift levers, as the steel shift shaft chews up aluminum splines and the lever can loosen over time.
