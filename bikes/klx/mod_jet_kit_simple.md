# Simple Jet Kit

[< KLX 250](../klx250.md)

The simple jet kit applies to carbureted KLX 250S models from 2009-2014. The parts in this kit can theoretically be installed in other CVK34 based models, but performance is untested. 

It can be used with a stock airbox and exhaust, but greater gains can be achieved by removing the airbox snorkel and installing an aftermarket exhaust.
