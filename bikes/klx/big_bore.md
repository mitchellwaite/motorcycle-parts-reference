# Big Bore Kits and Parts

[< KLX 250](../klx250.md)

This page lists big bore options for the KLX 250 and KLX 300. OEM parts, cloned OEM parts, and aftermarket big bore options are included.

If the valve cover gasket is worn, it is useful to replace when installing the big bore kit to prevent oil leaks. P/N `11060-1318` applies to all KLX 250 models and 1997-2007 KLX 300 models

For tuning, reference the appropriate tuning section from the previous page.

## 300cc (OEM parts)

Based on the posts on the KLX 250 forums, this is likely one of the more popular aftermarket options.

## Keng Engine 381cc/351cc/330cc

Keng Engine out of Thailand lists a number of kits from 300cc all the way to 351cc in their FB shop. However, there are posts indicating that 381cc kits are also available. All kits come with the cylinder, piston, and needed gaskets but also appear to include a set of cams, clutch springs, and for those that need it a bigger injector and a custom ECU or an EJK.

The 300cc kit uses all OE parts except for a pre-programmed aftermarket ECU.

## 300cc (Chinese parts)

The KLX engine has been cloned, and is used in a number of dirt bikes and ATVs made by chinese manufacturerrs. Because of this, sellers on aliexpress and eBay are able to offer big bore kits for significantly cheaper than what OEM kawasaki parts cost. The 299cc __AHL__ branded kits that are offered seem to work well, and appear to be compatible with the OEM cam chain tensioner. These cylinders have the letters "AHL" and "299" in the casting itself.

292cc kits also exist, but it is reported that there are differences in the cylinder that make it incompatible with the OEM cam chain tensioner and head gasket.
