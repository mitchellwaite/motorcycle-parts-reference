# KLX 250

[< Home](../index.md)

While the information on this page focuses mostly on the 2009+ carbureted KLX, there are a lot of similarities to previous and currently produced KLX 250 and 300 models. A version of the engine was used in the 2014 - 2017 Ninja 250SL and Z250SL models.

The engine has also been cloned as the YF300, and is used in a number of different 300cc Loncin models.
