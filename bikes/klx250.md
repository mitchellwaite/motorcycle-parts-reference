[CAUTION]
====
Some shift levers (such as the MSR SF-6413) do not have the pinch bolt in the correct location to interface with the cutout on the shift shaft, and thus do not guard against inadvertent removal of the shift lever

The shift shaft is made of steel, and will chew up the splines of aluminum shift levers.
