[CAUTION]
====
Some shift levers (such as the MSR SF-6413) do not have the pinch bolt in the correct location to interface with the cutout on the shift shaft, and thus do not guard against inadvertent removal of the shift lever
====

[NOTE]
====
The shift shaft is made of steel, and will chew up the splines of aluminum shift levers.
